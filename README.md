## Philosophy

Each class is an 'organization' on GitHub. This allows the instructors (GitHub organization Owners) to create, push, pull, and administer all repositories. This achieves two goals:

* Instructors can push code starter code to all students
* Instructors can easily browse/pull student code at any time during the assignment to assist in questions, check on progress

Each student is given a team in the organization. The team name is the same as the student's GitHub username.
